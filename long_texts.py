# In python when we put texts in quotation marks
# we are creating a certain data type which is 
# called string. 
# Everything that is inside quotation marks in python
# called string type.

# Let's say I want to display an email text in python
# For example:
# Hi,
# I hope this email finds you well. 
# I was wondering about our agreement.
print("""Hi,
I hope this email finds you well.
I was wondering about our agreement."""
) 
#Unlike other programming languages when we 
# have multiline string we have to define in 
# triple quotes(""" or ''').

print('''Hi,
I hope this email finds you well.
I was wondering about our agreement.''')

print('''Display this line''')
