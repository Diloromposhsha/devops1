# We need to create a program that will help us to calculate 
# average exam score of a student. 
# We are given three variables as exam1, exam2 and exam3. 
# Calculate average score for a student. 
# 70 40 97
# TO solve this question assign multiple variables in single line. 

exam1,exam2,exam3 = 70,40,97

avg_score = (exam1 + exam2 + exam3) / 3

#Problem
# In the line below I am printing the avg score however there is 
# nothing the output that indicates that. 
# The average exam score is 69 
print("The average exam score is",avg_score)

# In order to print multiple variables in single line we can use
# comma in between the variables. 
# whenever we use , to print multiple variables in single line
# comma adds space in between the variables.
